## Component Party

Component Party! It’s a lifesaver for anyone wanting a quick yet comprehensive view of different JS frameworks.

From reactivity to lifecycles, this site lays out code snippets side by side, showing how to tackle common tasks across frameworks. For someone like me, with a React background, it’s a fantastic way to start understanding Vue, Svelte, and more.
